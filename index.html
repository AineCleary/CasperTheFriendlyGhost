    <p>Casper the Friendly Ghost is the protagonist of many animated 
        tv series, video games, movies and even comic books. He's a 
        pleasant ghost who's often criticized by his three mean uncles, 
        the Ghostly Trio.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Casper was first created in the late 1930's by Seymour Reit who
    came up with the idea for the characer, and Joe Oriolo who provided
illustrations. Originally it was meant as a basis for a children's book.
When Reit was on military service during World War II, Oriolo sold the book
to Paramount Pictures' Famous Studios for a one time payment.<br>
The first Noveltoon to feature Casper was The Friendly Ghost, which was 
released by Paramount in 1945 with some differences from the book. He appears
in two more cartoons, There's Good Boos To-Night and A Haunting We Will Go. 
These were later adapted into Noveltoons before Paramount started a new series
in 1950 called Casper the Friendly Ghost.</p>
